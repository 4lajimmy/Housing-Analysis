SELECT   r.name AS Region_Name , w.channel, COUNT(w.channel) AS Num_Occurence
FROM web_events w 
JOIN accounts a 
ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r 
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY w.channel, r.name
ORDER BY COUNT(w.channel) DESC;

2.	How many accounts have more than 20 orders?

SELECT a.name as Name, COUNT(*) AS Num_Accounts
FROM accounts a 
JOIN orders o 
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY  a.name
HAVING COUNT(*)>20
ORDER BY a.name ASC;

3. Which accounts spent more than 30,000 usd total across all orders?

SELECT a.name AS Account_Name, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS Total_Amount
FROM accounts a 
JOIN orders o 
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY  a.name
HAVING SUM( total_amt_usd)> 30000
ORDER BY SUM( total_amt_usd) DESC;

4. 	Which accounts used facebook as a channel to contact customers more    than 6 times?

SELECT   a.name, w.channel, COUNT(w.channel) AS Num_Occurence
FROM web_events w 
JOIN accounts a 
ON a.id = w.account_id
GROUP BY w.channel, a.name
HAVING channel = 'facebook' AND COUNT(w.channel) >6
ORDER BY COUNT(w.channel) DESC;

5.	Which account has the most orders?

SELECT a.name AS Account_Name, SUM(o.Total) AS Max_Value
from accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.name
HAVING SUM(o.Total) = (SELECT  MAX(Total_Orders) AS Maximum_orders
 FROM (SELECT a.name, sum(o.Total) as Total_Orders
from accounts a 
JOIN orders o 
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY a.name) T1);

6. How many accounts spent more than 30,000 USD across all orders?

SELECT count(*) AS Total_Number_Of_Accounts
